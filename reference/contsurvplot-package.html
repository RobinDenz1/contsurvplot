What is this package about?
This package provides different plotting routines to visualize the causal effect of a continuous variable on a time-to-event outcome using a previously fit model and g-computation. Unlike simpler alternatives, such as plotting survival curves for some categories, these plots always correspond to the results obtained by the time-to-event model and give an accurate depiction of the causal effect, if all assumptions are met.
What features are included in this package?
The package includes 10 different plot functions, most based on the ggplot2 package. Those 10 plotting routines include value specific survival curves, landmark survival probability plots, survival time quantile plots, survival probability heatmaps, and survival area plots, among others. A description and comparison of these plots can be found in the article associated with this R-package (Denz &amp;amp; Timmesfeld 2022).
What does a typical workflow using this package look like?
All the user has to do is fit a time-to-event model, such as the cox-model, including the continuous variable of interest (and possibly confounders) and plug it into one of the plot functions included in this package. Many different kind of models are supported. See curve_cont for more details.
What type of plot should I use?
There is no general answer to this question, but we would usually suggest using a plot method that is able to visualize the causal survival probability both as a function of time and as a function of the continuous variable. The plot_surv_area, plot_surv_heatmap and plot_surv_contour functions do just that. More discussion about this topic can be found in the vignette and the associated paper.
Where can I get more information?
The documentation pages contain a lot of information, relevant examples and literature references. Additional examples can be found in the vignette of this package, which can be accessed using vignette(topic="introduction", package="contsurvplot"). We are also currently working on an article focused on the two novel plotting methods plot_surv_area and plot_surv_contour.
